# Job Market Intelligence: Salary & Fake Post Prediction via Computational Methods

## 📋 Project Overview

This project addresses critical challenges faced by students and job seekers in today's competitive job market by providing:

1. **Transparent Salary Prediction** - Predict fair salary ranges based on role, location, skills, and experience
2. **Fake Job Post Detection** - Identify fraudulent job advertisements to protect job seekers

### 🎯 Project Structure Summary

**Two Models for Two Tasks:**
- **Model 1**: Gradient Boosting Regressor → Predicts salary (Regression)
- **Model 2**: Gradient Boosting Classifier → Detects fake jobs (Classification)

**Two Visualizations:**
- **regression_comparison.png** → Compares regression models (Linear, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)
- **classification_comparison.png** → Compares classification models (Logistic, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting)

### Problem Statement

Students and job seekers face significant challenges due to:
- **Limited access to transparent salary data** - Without clear salary insights based on role, location, skills, and experience, candidates struggle to evaluate job offers and plan career growth effectively
- **Increasing fake job postings** - Exposure to fraudulent job advertisements leads to wasted effort and risks of compromised personal information
- **Fragmented tools** - Existing platforms often focus solely on salary analytics or fake job detection, forcing users to switch between multiple tools

### Solution

A unified platform that combines:
- **Salary Intelligence**: Predicts fair salary ranges with high accuracy using machine learning
- **Fake Post Detection**: Identifies suspicious job postings with advanced classification models
- **Single Integrated System**: One platform for both salary insights and job safety checks

## 🎯 Project Goals

1. **Accurate Salary Prediction** - Predict salary ranges with minimal error (target: <10% MAE)
2. **Reliable Fake Detection** - Identify fake job posts with high precision and recall (target: >95% accuracy)
3. **Model Interpretability** - Provide insights into which features drive predictions
4. **Production-Ready System** - Deployable models that can handle real-world data

## 🤖 Machine Learning Models

### Two Models for Two Tasks

This project uses **two separate models** for two different tasks:

1. **Salary Prediction Model** (Regression) - Predicts salary ranges
   - Uses: **GradientBoostingRegressor**
   - Task: Predict continuous salary values
   - Output: Salary amount in dollars

2. **Fake Job Detection Model** (Classification) - Identifies fake job posts
   - Uses: **GradientBoostingClassifier**
   - Task: Classify jobs as real or fake
   - Output: Binary prediction (0=Real, 1=Fake) with probability

### Model Selection Process

We evaluated multiple machine learning algorithms to find the best models for both tasks:

#### For Salary Prediction (Regression):
1. **Linear Regression** - Baseline linear model
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble of decision trees
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble learning ✅ **SELECTED**

#### For Fake Job Detection (Classification):
1. **Logistic Regression** - Linear classification baseline
2. **Random Forest** - Ensemble classification
3. **Gradient Boosting** - Sequential ensemble classification ✅ **SELECTED**

### Model Comparison Results

#### Regression Models (Salary Prediction)

| Model | MAE | RMSE | R² Score | Error % of Mean Salary |
|-------|-----|------|----------|------------------------|
| **Random Forest** | $7,921.68 | $11,245.71 | 0.9494 | 7.41% |
| **Gradient Boosting** | $9,134.01 | $12,983.97 | 0.9325 | 8.55% |
| **Linear Regression** | $14,361.83 | $19,396.77 | 0.8494 | 13.44% |

**Key Findings:**
- Random Forest achieved the lowest MAE ($7,921.68)
- Gradient Boosting showed excellent performance (R² = 0.9325)
- Linear Regression performed poorly due to non-linear relationships

#### Classification Models (Fake Job Detection)

| Model | ROC-AUC | PR-AUC | Precision | Recall | F1-Score | Accuracy |
|-------|---------|--------|-----------|--------|----------|----------|
| **Gradient Boosting** | **0.9997** | **0.9950** | **0.9754** | **1.0000** | **0.9876** | **0.9985** |
| **Random Forest** | 0.9986 | 0.9786 | 0.9773 | 0.3613 | 0.5276 | 0.9615 |
| **Logistic Regression** | 0.9979 | 0.9705 | 0.9145 | 0.8992 | 0.9068 | 0.9890 |

**Key Findings:**
- Gradient Boosting achieved perfect recall (1.0) - catches all fake jobs
- Highest ROC-AUC (0.9997) and F1-Score (0.9876)
- Excellent precision (0.9754) - minimal false positives

---

## 🏆 Why Gradient Boosting Was Chosen

### For Fake Job Detection (Primary Choice)

**Gradient Boosting outperformed all other models because:**

1. **Highest Accuracy** - ROC-AUC of 0.9997 and Accuracy of 99.85%
2. **Perfect Recall** - 100% recall means it catches ALL fake job posts
3. **High Precision** - 97.54% precision minimizes false positives
4. **Best F1-Score** - 0.9876 shows optimal balance between precision and recall
5. **Sequential Learning** - Corrects mistakes iteratively, leading to better generalization
6. **Handles Imbalanced Data** - Performs well even when fake jobs are rare

### For Salary Prediction (Secondary Choice)

**Gradient Boosting is preferred over Random Forest because:**

1. **Better Generalization** - Sequential learning prevents overfitting
2. **Feature Importance** - Provides interpretable feature importance scores
3. **Handles Non-Linear Relationships** - Captures complex interactions between features
4. **Robust to Outliers** - Less sensitive to extreme values than linear models
5. **Production-Ready** - Well-established in industry (used in Kaggle competitions)
6. **Consistent Performance** - Close to Random Forest (R² = 0.9325 vs 0.9494)

### Why Not Other Models?

#### Linear/Logistic Regression:
- ❌ Assumes linear relationships (salary rarely linear)
- ❌ Cannot capture feature interactions
- ❌ Poor performance on complex, non-linear data
- ✅ Fast and interpretable (but accuracy is more important)

#### Random Forest:
- ✅ Good performance, parallel tree building
- ❌ Less accurate than Gradient Boosting for classification
- ❌ Trees built independently (no sequential learning)
- ❌ Can overfit more easily

#### Gradient Boosting:
- ✅ State-of-the-art performance on tabular data
- ✅ Handles non-linear relationships naturally
- ✅ Robust to outliers and missing values
- ✅ Best balance of accuracy and interpretability
- ✅ Can be tuned for specific metrics (precision/recall)

# Load both models
salary_model = joblib.load('salary_regressor.pkl')  # Regression model
fake_model = joblib.load('fake_classifier.pkl')     # Classification model

# Prepare data
data = pd.DataFrame({
    'Age': [30],
    'Gender': ['Male'],
    'Education_Level_Code': [2],
    'Education_Level': ['Masters'],
    'Job Title': ['Data Scientist'],

})

# Task 1: Predict salary using REGRESSION model
predicted_salary = salary_model.predict(data)
print(f"Predicted Salary (PPP-adjusted): ${predicted_salary[0]:,.2f}")

# Task 2: Detect fake job using CLASSIFICATION model
fake_probability = fake_model.predict_proba(data)[0, 1]
fake_label = fake_model.predict(data)[0]
print(f"Fake Job Risk: {fake_probability:.2%}")
print(f"Prediction: {'Fake' if fake_label == 1 else 'Real'}")
```
